Example 1 - double_poll
	This example is in two versions:
	1) Show how is simple encounter a deadlock
	2) Same example in actor style  

Esempio 2 - how_many_actors
	There is not an equivalence between actors and thread. How many threads can 
	we create? How much memory do we use?

Esempio 3 - err_mng
	How we can manage errors in an actor system? Let it crash paradigm. 

Esempio 4 - proxy_actor
	This program make a proxy between a local and a remote end point, let
	it crash in action.

Esempio 5 - http_actor
	We create a simple http web server. How much memory do we use? Ho wmany
	request can we serve? Is it fast?

TODO:
Parse the http request and generate the http response dynamically.
