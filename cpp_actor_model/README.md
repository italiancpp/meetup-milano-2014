C++ Actor Model
=================

Some code to explain Actor Model in C++.

You need [libcppa](https://github.com/Neverlord/libcppa) for the C++ examples. This is the main topic of the talk so please download it :smile:.

You also need a [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/) v 4.8 to support C++11.

For the [node](http://nodejs.org/) examples you need a node installation, you can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

For the [eralng](http://www.erlang.org/) examples you can install it using [kerl](https://github.com/cqwww/kerl). I used [cowboy](https://github.com/extend/cowboy) to test http over erlang.

Please refer to README on subdirs to more details.
